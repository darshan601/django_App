# django_App

Created a Django App StudyBuddy which is similar to Discord.

Create a virtual environment :

# Let's install virtualenv first
pip install virtualenv

# Then we create our virtual environment
virtualenv envname
--> Activate the virtual environment :

envname\scripts\activate
--> Install the requirements :

pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the App
--> To run the App, we use :

python manage.py runserver
âš  Then, the development server will be started at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
